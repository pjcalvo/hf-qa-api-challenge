Pablo Challenge for API testing

# Description
I decided to use PostMan and Newman for the api testing for 2 main reasons:
* It is super easy to use from the CLI and the tests are super easy to create and maintain, and I wanted to keep it simple.

# installation process
## Prerequisites
In order to be able to run this demo the following requirements should be met:
* Latest version of [NodeJs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
```
npm i -g newman
```

## Running the tests
```
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5f1638b111eff21732a6
```

# Extra details
The collection can also be imported into PostMan and executed from there, in the example I use NewMan which is the CLI for postman.
